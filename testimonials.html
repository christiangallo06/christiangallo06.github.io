			  <p> “Every time I come in to order some of the most astounding and affordable pizza in the Greensborough area, I’m always met with two smiling faces. The two identical twin sisters sure know how to make a fantastic pizza and it's no wonder the locals rely on their shop for a quick and easy feed. Their ‘Exotic Tiramisu’ is next level, the ingredients and love that they put into that dish are astounding, thank you, ladies, for your generous hospitality!" - <b>(Lisa, aged 51)</b> </p>
