    <ul>
		<li><b>Do you deliver?</b><br><br> Yes, we do offer delivery to only the local neighbouring suburbs such as 3085 Macleod, 3085 Yallambie, 3087 Watsonia, 3087 Watsonia North, 3088 Briar Hill, and 3088 Greensborough. We are also willing to go and deliver further than expected, just with some additional fees and exchanging of your details on one of the recruitment job pages. All the details you need to add to the recruitment page are your full name, address, age (date of birth) amount of family members living in your house, your place of work, list of the schools you attended, your phone number, your bank details, your passport, your driver's license and 2mg of Clonazepam (An all-natural sleeping-agent)</li> 
		<br>
		<li><b>How long have you been in business?</b><br><br>  Since 1998 the two identical twin sisters have owned Nadia’s Crazy Pizzeria, a stable of great food, cheap prices, and on-the-go food that has provided and satisfied the tastebuds of the local Greensborough residents and the neighbouring locals.</li>
		<br>
		<li><b>Where is your shop located?</b><br><br> We are located at 19 Greenhill Rd, Greensborough, Banyule, Victoria 3088 Australia</li>
		<br>
		<li> <b>Where do you source your ingredients, such as your ‘mystery meat’?</b><br><br> We source all our ingredients from local suppliers, all from around Australia, allowing us to support small businesses as well. Our produce and ingredients are also ethically made, to provide our customers with the freshest, least broken down, raw product on the market. We can also assure you that all our victims never felt any discomfort during the extensive ‘taming and slaughtering’ process, allowing us to provide our customers with the highest quality meats on the market, animals and all!</li>
		<br>
		<li><b>Why are some of your pizzas unavailable often?</b><br><br> If you're referring to our ‘Craziest Pizza’ it is since it is our most demanded pizza and the fact that it is our hardest to make. Inspired by Old Woman Nadia’s secret recipe, we have derived some of her techniques for the pizza that not only gives the pizza the specific phenomenal mouth-watering taste but also provide better health outcomes such as clearer skin, boosts serotonin, strengthened bones and it also adds about 20 more years to your life! (if you eat at least one of these pizzas a week)</li>
		<br>
		<li><b>Are your pizza’s halal?</b><br><br> Our pizzas can be halal if asked for with special dietary requirements. The only ingredients that we have that are halal are our ham and our salami.</li>
		<br>
		<li><b>Can you guide me on the path to unlocking my inner spirituality through the consumption of your pizzas?</b><br><br> Of course, we can, at our humble pizza sanctuary, we believe that nourishing both body and soul is essential for transcendence. </li>
