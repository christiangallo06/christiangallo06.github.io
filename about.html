		   <p> Nadia’s Crazy Pizzeria was founded by Nadia De Cesaris in 1998, she co-founded it with her identical twin sister, Nadia De Cesaris the second. </p>

<p> Starting from humble beginnings, these two sisters have paved the way that we have eaten pizza for over 20 years. Their most famous pizza, <b><i>The Maniac,</i></b> features all their toppings, including some top-secret ingredients. Being humble wasn't easy for both identical twin sisters, as they grew up rough and with some very old-school parents. They were forced to witness the horror of losing the most crucial thing in their lives, their local pizza woman, who was also named Nadia. They erected a statue of old woman Nadia in their restaurant to honour and to keep her legacy alive, as she provided all the local families of Greensborough with cheap homemade pizzas.</p> 
<p> They also continued her legacy with their inspiration from her special special secret sauce, which she used for her own pizza bases. Well known to critics and locals alike, the Nadia sisters have created an experience that you will never, ever, forget... when you join their ritualistic cult of course, we mean, their delicious pizza's… </p>

<p>So come down to Nadia’s Crazy Pizzeria, where the prices are low, the pizzas are crispy, and you will go stir crazy... for Nadia’s Crazy Pizzeria! </p>
